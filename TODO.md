# Nightfall Build Plan

## Production Minigames
The minigame system is in place with KitchenRush implemented. Remaining minigames to build:

- [ ] Fresh Check (Food): Conveyor sort minigame - swipe left/right to sort fresh vs spoiled ingredients
- [ ] Gear Up (Equipment): Alignment minigame - drag spinning gear to mesh with fixed gear at right moment
- [ ] Patch Job (Equipment): Tracing minigame - trace welding line along cracks before they spread
- [ ] Power Up (Energy): Rhythm minigame - tap to spin generator, maintain RPM in sweet spot
- [ ] Salvage Run (Materials): Timing windows minigame - hit action when oscillating marker is in clean zone

## Mechanics & Balancing
- [ ] Region Resizing: Reduce the default size of the active region area for tighter gameplay

## Future Immersion & Polish (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Regional Broadcast Channels: Implement a second SSE channel per-region for real-time animations
- [ ] Map Performance: Implement clustering or advanced MapLibre styling for high feature density
- [ ] Soundscape: Add dynamic ambient audio that shifts with the day/night cycle
